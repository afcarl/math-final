# math-final

Final for Mr. Hamilton's period 3 IB HL Math class. This Python script is a simple markov chain that adapts to subconscious rock paper scissors player tendencies.

Ths Python script is by no means PEP8 compliant.
It is by no means a good CLI.
If you want to see serious programming work, look at a repo of code that wasn't written in half an hour!
